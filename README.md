# node-xsyn
Extensible syntax for nodejs

This project provides the possibility to define new languages (DSLs) by means of context-free grammars. Node-xsyn works similarly as some well-known tools lex/yacc/bison by allowing to attach processing rules to each of the grammar production rules. Node-xsyn is fully integrated into the node module system; language definitions can be compiled into node modules and re-used as needed.
