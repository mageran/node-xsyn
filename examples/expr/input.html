This is an example of the use of code-brackets. The grammar has defined options
<kbd>%codeStart</kbd> and <kbd>%codeEnd</kbd> at the beginning of the grammar file, which means that only the text
in between these symbols is used for processing (in this case &lt;expr&gt; and &lt;/expr&gt;). If integrated into an HTML file
(as it is done here), special style attributes can be given to the code parts (check out the page source for this.)

<expr>(5 + 8)
 * 12
</expr>

This feature allows for 'literate programming', which makes the documentation and the actual code one integral part.
It's - so to speak - the inverse of the usual approach, where the comments are used within the source code.
<p>
The following snippet will actually be appended to the above calculation:

<expr> - 19 </expr>

(this doesn't make a lot of sense in this example; it's for illustration purposes).
<p>
You can now actually use this html file as input to the expression parser and process it the same way as any other input:
<pre>
expr.parser.run({inputFile : 'input.html'})
</pre>
</body>
